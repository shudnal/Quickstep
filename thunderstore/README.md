# Quickstep
Ever wanted your viking to be more fast paced?

By default quickstep only enabled for knives and unarmed (currenly only Flesh rippers).

But you can enable whatever weapon class you want.

If you perform quickstep with shield equipped then invincibility frames will be lowered (configurable) and by default it is first 60% of dash time.

## Features:
* set dash time and force if you're not satisfied with default behaviour
* set invincibility time for quickstep with shield (by default 150 milliseconds of 250 milliseconds of dash)
* set stamina usage multiplier and dash cooldown
* server synced config

## Installation (manual)
Extract Quickstep.dll file to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder

## Compatibility
* The mod should be compatible with any mods changing item prices to make it sellable and extending tradeable item lists
* Incompatible with any mod hiding vanilla store UI
* Mod should be compatible with mods adding more traders with unique names (until they use vanilla store UI)
